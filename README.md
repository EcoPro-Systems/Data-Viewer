# EcoPro Data Viewer

Application bundle that includes a Common Mapping Client frontend and GeoServer backend.

### Getting Started

- Make sure you have [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) installed
  - `brew install git-lfs` (or whatever your OS says to do) - adds LFS support to git cli on your machine
  - `git lfs install` - enables git lfs for your user account
- Make sure you have a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) runtime installed ([Rancher](https://rancherdesktop.io/) should work too)
- Pull down latest GeoServer data bundle from [Artifactory](https://artifactory.jpl.nasa.gov/)
  - !!!! IN PROGRESS !!!!
- `./scripts/unpack.sh`
- `./scripts/start.sh`
  - wait a few minutes for GeoServer to start up
- Go to `http://localhost` for the data viewer
- Go to `http://localhost/geoserver` for the GeoServer admin portal

### Scripts

- `pack.sh` - packs the geoserver_data directory into a tarball for transferring
- `unpack.sh` - unpacks the geoserver_data tarball for serving
- `build.sh`- builds the docker images and sets up data directories
- `start.sh`- builds and starts the docker containers (optional `-d` to start container in the background)
- `stop.sh`- stops and removes all the running containers
- Python scripts:
  - Setup
    - Create virtualenv: `python -m venv pyvenv`
      - `source pyvenv/bin/activate`
    - Install: `pip install -e .[dev]`
  - Scripts:
    - `convert_kelp_biomass`: Converts NetCDF of Kelp Biomass historical data to a bunch of Shapefiles
    - `import_raster_files`: Bulk import raster data files into GeoServer

### Note on Docker

Docker can tend to get clogged up with cached layers, especially if one is repeatedly stopping/rebuilding/starting these containers. These out of date containers and image layers can lead to some unreliability with the GeoServer backend. As such, it is recommended to run `docker system prune` regularly to keep this cruft from interfering. This issue has been noted particularly on Apple M1 systems.

### common-mapping-client_build

Once you have run `./scripts/start.sh -d` there should be a new directory present called `common-mapping-client_build`. This directory contains the built and deployed assets for the frontend common-mapping-client viewer, its contents are mounted from the Docker container serving the files. You can modify the `config.js` and `*.json` in this directory and have them reflected in the active deployment. Note that you must duplicate these changes in the `common-mapping-client` source directory if you plan on rebuilding the frontend in the future, otherwise the changes will be overwritten.

### GeoServer management

The admin username:pass is set as `admin:cmc_geoserver` it is highly advised to change this
